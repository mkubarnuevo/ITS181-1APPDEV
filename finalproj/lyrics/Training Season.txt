TRAINING SEASON - Dua Lipa
...

Are you someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
Play fair, is that a compass in your nature?
Or are you tricky?
'Cause I've been there
And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice

But if you really wanna go there
You should know I

I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul
Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo

Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over (training season's over)

I tried to see my lovers in a good light
Don't wanna do it just to be nice
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right

I hope it hits me like an arrow
Someone with some potential
Is it too much to ask for, who understands?

I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul
Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo

Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over

Can you compete?
Now is your time
Run when you hear that whistle blow
Are you on my team?
Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go?

For someone to tell you to go
You should know I

I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah)
Conversation overload 'cause training season's over
'Cause training season's over (training season's over)

Training season's over
