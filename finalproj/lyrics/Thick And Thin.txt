THICK AND THIN - LANY 

...

Late night
Your eyes fell to the floor
I'm trying to make sense
But you're losing your patience
Hands talk, won't stop
We go to war
In the heat of the moment
You think that we're broken

I could see my whole life with you baby
Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
Cause you're...

Out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin

Can't sleep, can't eat
My mind's a mess
What are you thinking?
You were happy last weekend
All the good times
How'd you forget?
I was your best friend, yeah
Remember when you said

You could see your whole life with me baby
Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
Cause you're...

Out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin

Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything

Now you're out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
Out the door
Just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love
If you can leave me for
Something so innocent
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin

Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
